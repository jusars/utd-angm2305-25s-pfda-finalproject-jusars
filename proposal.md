# Asteroids game
### https://github.com/jusars/utd-angm2305-25s-pfda-finalproject-jusars

### Description
A top down view game where the player can move using the keyboard, shooting at randomly spawned asteroids as they try not to collide with them and blow up. It's entertainment :D

### Features
Features that could reasonably use PyGame: 
- Movement with either arrow keys or WASD 
- Spacekey to shoot
- Colission box for player
- Start and end functionality (fullscreen game window with exit)
- Score feature

- Randomly spawning asteroids of a preset amount of sizes
Likely have to draw particles with collison or hitboxes? Using draw code and maybe PyGame together.

### Challenges
- Learning how to add collision to a "player"
- Programming animations and if that's possible?
- Adding projectiles that have their own collision, velocity, and origin point
- Calculating and keeping track of score per asteroid destroyed

### Outcomes
Ideal outcome:
- Fully functional (Movement, shooting, dying, respawning, score)
- Self-made art or spritework, visually pleasing.
Minimal Viable outcome:
- Movement and dying. Pivot to just dodging asteroids if too many things go wrong.

### Weekly Milestones
1. Movement + shooting
2. Collision + scoring
3. Spawning system for asteroids, death and respawning
4. Art and assets

\\FOR THE RECORD 3: following a third, different tutorial than previously - got way too lost unfortunately! serious apologies.
